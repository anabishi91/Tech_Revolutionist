Deep-dive Listing of my various Proficients , Project Engagements , Recognition/Honors&Awards are detailed over my resume , which with all due respect & immense Pleasure I invite you to go-through please . 

On a Personal Background you will feel me as, and yet again its my humble belief that I'm , a Practical/Self-Instilled/resilient/retrospective Individual who is keen to constantly embrace new observations and adapt them in my day-to-day usage . And Socially , over a group ,you will perceive me as a Natural/Empathetic/Effective Administrator-cum-Leader who believes practice-what-you-direct and direct-only-that-you-practice way of Leading . 
Aside , if you would also notice the energizing-radiance I have as an Individual or the radiating-energy I emanate as a Leader , you would know I source them from my Martial-Arts , Yoga practices which construct the Passion front of me .
